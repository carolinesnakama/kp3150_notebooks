        "Humans are able to control their rates of heat production and heat loss to maintain a nearly constant core temperature of T$_c$ = 37 °C under a wide range of environmental conditions. This process is called thermoregulation. From the perspective of calculating heat transfer between a human body and its surroundings, we can define the control volume to be the interface between the surface of a layer of skin and fat, and the environment. The inner surface is slightly less than the core temperature T$_i$ = 35 °C.\r\n",
        "Consider a person with a skin/fat layer of thickness L = 3 mm and effective thermal conductivity k = 0.3 W/m$\\cdot$K. The person has a surface area A = 1.8 m$^2$ and the emissivity of the skin is ε = 0.95.\r\n",
        "When the person is in still air at T$_\\infty$ = 297 K, what is the skin surface temperature and rate of heat loss to the environment? Convection heat transfer to the air is characterized by a free convection coefficient of h = 2 W/m$^2$K."

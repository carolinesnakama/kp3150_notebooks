        "Hot exhaust gases are used to heat pressurized water at a flow rate of 1 kg/s from 35 to 125 $^o$ C. The gases enter a finned-tube cross-flow heat exchanger at 300 $^o$ C and leave at 100 $^o$ C. The overall heat transfer coefficient $U$ = 100 W/m $^2$ K. Determine the required surface area using the NTU method. (Specific heat capacity of water at the mean temperature 80 $^o$ C: $C_p$ = 4197 J/kg.K)\n",
